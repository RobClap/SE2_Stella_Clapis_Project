\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Description of the given problem}
Since TAXI services in big cities are generally hard to access to and even when they are not they are generally not organized on a big scale we plan to build a centralized coordinating app to solve the problem. 
\\\\We propose a different approach to current TAXIes organizations which are mainly currently done with phone calls and just only one big queue that comprehends all TAXIes available for a city.
This not only affect accessibility to the service but also increases pollution in urban areas. 
\\\\Our solution plans to make use modern technologies (mainly smartphones) to solve both problems: the app for the clients will make easier to call for a TAXI or make a reservation for it, while the app for the TAXIes will organize the queueing in a more granular way in order to ensure coverage of city areas and reduce to a minimum the trip a car has to make to reach his client. 
\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make easier for a TAXI to reach his client
\item Make easier for a TAXI driver to check-in and notify his availability
\item Make easier for the client to call for a TAXI
\item Make possible for the client to place a reservation for a TAXI 
\end{itemize}
