\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). It aims at explaining the domain of the system to be developed and the system itself in terms of functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements and constraints. It also provides several models of the system and typical use cases. It is intended for all the developers who will have to implement the system, the testers who will have to determine if the requirements have been met and the system analysts who will have to write specifications for other system that will relate to this one. It is also intended as a contractual basis thus being legally binding.

\subsection{Actual System}
The government of the city wants to optimise its taxi service with a completely new application. Therefore, we assume there are no previous systems to take into account.

\subsection{Scope}
The aim of the project myTaxiService is to provide a new application to optimise the taxi service of the city that will be accessible via browser, mobile or public APIs.
\\The city managed by myTaxiService is divided in zones of 2 km\textsuperscript{2} each and every zone has its own queue of taxis. The queues are automatically computed by the system with the information it receives from the GPS of the phones of the taxi drivers.
\\Taxi drivers can be available or not. Only available taxi drivers can be in a queue. When a taxi driver changes her state from not available to available the system automatically adds her to the queue of the zone she is currently in, based on the information of the GPS of her phone. 
\\Users that are not registered can only see the estimated time of arrival of the nearest taxi with myTaxiService.\@
\\Registered users can also request a taxi or make a reservation for a taxi. Reservations can only be made at least two hours before the ride and must be done specifying the starting location, the destination and the meeting time. Requests, instead, only need the starting location and the destination.
\\When a request is made, the first taxi driver of the queue of the starting location's zone is prompted to accept or reject it. If the taxi driver rejects it her state is automatically put on unavailable by the system. If a taxi driver doesn't accept or reject the request within 1 minute, it will be passed on to the next taxi driver in the queue and the first one will be moved to the end of the queue. If there are no available taxis in the zone of the request the system will propagate the request to the closest available taxi.
\\When a request is accepted, the user that has made the request receives a notification from the system informing her of the code of the incoming taxi and the estimated time of arrival.
\\When a reservation is made, the system confirms it to the user and allocates a taxi 10 minutes before the meeting time. If a taxi for that zone is not available the closest available taxi will be notified. When a taxi driver accepts the reservation, the user receives from the system the code of the incoming taxi. If a taxi driver doesn't accept or reject the reservation within 1 minute, it will be passed on to the next taxi driver in the queue and the first one will be moved to the end of the queue.
\\Requests can be cancelled before they have been accepted by a taxi driver while reservation can be cancelled until 10 minutes before the meeting time.

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide an easy way to request a taxi.
	\item Provide an easy way to reserve a taxi.
	\item Guarantee a fair management of the taxi queues.
	\item Create an extensible system that allows expansion and interactions with other services.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition and Acronyms}

\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Guest:} a person that has to sign up or log in the system.
	\item \textit{Secure Channel:} a communication channel to ensure privacy and authenticity for both the server and the clients 
	\item \textit{Logged in user:} a person that has already signed up and logged in the system.
	\item \textit{Administrator:} a person authorised to modify the list of taxi drivers stored by the system.
	\item \textit{Request:} a call from a registered user who needs a taxi immediately.
	\item \textit{Meeting time:} the date and time in which the logged in user needs the taxi in case of reservation. 
	\item \textit{Reservation:} a booking of a taxi at a certain meeting time.
	\item \textit{State of a taxi driver:} the state the taxi driver is currently in. It can be available or not available. Taxi drivers are in a queue if and only if they're available.
	\item \textit{Closest available taxi:} if there are no taxis in the zone of the request or of the reservation, the system automatically finds the closest available taxi choosing the one with the smallest estimated time of arrival from the taxi queues of the other zones.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Acronyms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ETA:\@ estimated time of arrival: the time, estimated by the system, that the closest available taxi will take to get to the starting location of the ride.
	\item CAT:\@ closest available taxi (see definition in the previous period).
	\item API:\@ application programming interface; it is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications on top of this one.
	\item MAD:\@ maximum allowed delay; the maximum time, calculated by the system according to its information about distance and traffic, that a taxi driver has to get to the starting location of a request. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Actors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Guest}: guests are able to sign up, login or ask the system for an ETA.\@
	\item \textit{Logged in users}: after successfully logging in, registered users can request or reserve taxis or ask the system for an ETA.\@
	\item \textit{Taxi drivers}: after successfully logging in, taxi drivers are able to set their current state as available or not and to accept or refuse requests.
	\item \textit{Administrator}: after successfully logging in, the administrator will be the only user allowed to edit the taxi drivers list stored by the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
This document is structured in three parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction: gives an high-level description of the software purposes and context.
	\item Overall Description: gives a general description of the application, focusing on the context of the system, going in details about domain assumptions and constraints. The aim of this section is to provide a context to the whole project and show its integration with the real world.
	\item Specific Requirements: this section contains all of the software requirements to a level of detail aimed to be enough to design a system to satisfy said requirements, and testers to test that the system actually satisfies them. It also contains the detailed description of the possible interactions between the system and the world with a simulation and preview of the expected response of the system with given stimulation. (Details are given with Alloy specifications and UML diagrams)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=1.5\textwidth]{TWATM}}%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Blair The Witch had to take her magical broom to the mechanic for the annual revision but she needs to go shopping to refill her stockpile of frog's tails. Her friend Mizune has told her about myTaxiService, so she decides to give it a try. After downloading it on her smartphone, she signs up compiling the registration form with her username, password and email. Now she can complain about how slow car-based transports are!
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Suzuka is having a date tonight but, unfortunately, her car doesn't want to start. After several failures, she decides to use myTaxiService\@. After logging in, she requests a taxi specifying her home as the starting location and the restaurant's address as the destination. The system notifies Takeshi, the first taxi driver of the queue in Suzuka's zone, of the request. Takeshi accepts the request and the system sends Suzuka the code of Takeshi's taxi and the ETA so she can finally get to her date.
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Ash Ketchum has to start his new adventure in Hoenn tomorrow but his mother is busy cleaning the house with Mr.\ Mime, so she can't take him to the airport to meet Prof.\ Oak. Ash decides to use once again myTaxiService to reserve a taxi. After logging in, he makes a reservation for a taxi specifying the starting location as Pallet town, the destination and the meeting time. The morning after, 10 minutes before the meeting time, the system allocates Brock's taxi for the reservation and sends his code to Ash so that he knows who he'll meet to start his new adventure. 
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
Donald Duck is ready to start his first day as a taxi driver in Paperopoli. He jumps on his car, logs in myTaxiService and changes his state to available. Unfortunately he doesn't know that, in his zone, there are 15 taxis in the queue before him, so he'll have to be patient for some time.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
After quite some time, Daisy requests a taxi and it's finally Donald's turn! The system notifies him but it's breakfast time and Donald's having a cappuccino in a very crowded bar. He doesn't hear the notification popping on his phone so, after 1 minute, the system forwards Daisy's request to the next taxi driver in the queue and changes Donald's state to not available.
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
Mickey Mouse is planning to go fishing with Pluto tomorrow. After logging in myTaxiService, he makes two reservations: one for the morning and one for the evening. But, while he's enjoying his evening watching a movie, the phone rings. It's Minnie and she's reminding Mickey that they he had promised to go shopping with her the day after. Sadly, he has to say goodbye to his fishing trip and cancels the taxi reservations.
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
It's almost Christmas and Tokyo is very crowded! Holo needs to go to Supergulp to buy the last Christmas gifts but it's cold and it's snowing so she logs in myTaxiService and requests a taxi. Unfortunately, the snow is scaring taxi drivers and they keep rejecting Holo's request one after the other. 5 minutes later, Holo sees that her request has yet to be accepted so she cancels it and decides to walk.
\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
Asuna is getting bored at home so she comes up with the idea of visiting Leafa. As she doesn't have a driving license, she switches on her computer and goes to myTaxiService website to look for the ETA\@. Unfortunately, today there's a party at Yato's shrine and the CAT is very far from Asuna's home so she decides to change her plans and cook something to kill the time.

\end{itemize}
\textit{Postconditions:} The taxi driver is not available anymore and has been removed from the queue.
\\\textit{Exceptions:} If a taxi driver doesn't get to the starting location of the request within the MAD, the system will pass on the request to the next taxi driver in the queue and will notify the user of the change with the new ETA and taxi code. If the queue is empty, the system will notify the CAT.\@\\

\\\textit{Exceptions:} If a taxi driver accepts the request while the user is cancelling it the system will show an error message and won't cancel the request
\begin{figure}[H]
	In order to avoid redundancy the situation in which the client cancels before a taxi accepts is not in the sequence diagram but it is totally alike the one in which the taxi refuses the call, just the client cancels before the taxi can accept.\\

\section{Alloy}
\subsection{Model}
In order to adapt a pure logical model to a system that changes with time and, in the mean time, not lose meaningfulness the following
main adaptations were made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ``serve'' relation (AvailableTaxi \textrightarrow\-ActiveClient) is used to represent the association the system made before a taxi was removed from the queue in order to serve a client.
	\item The ``refused'' relation (InactiveTaxi \textrightarrow\-ActiveClient) is used to represent a refusal of a request by a taxi that was active.
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\subsection{Worlds Generated}
The following worlds were generated changing parameters about arity of present signatures in the show\{\} predicate.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=1.5\textwidth]{Alloy/2Areas}}%
	\\This is a clean example of two areas, each one with a single client, no unusual interaction occur.\\
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=1.5\textwidth]{Alloy/CrossAreaService}}%
	\\This is a more complex example, here we can see how the system behaves and the model adjusts if there aren't enough taxis in an area in order to serve all the clients.
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	  \makebox[\textwidth][c]{\includegraphics[width=1.5\textwidth]{Alloy/reserved-and-refused}}%
	\\In this scenario we can see both a reservation of a client for a determined area and a refusal of a taxi for a client (now being served by an other taxi)
