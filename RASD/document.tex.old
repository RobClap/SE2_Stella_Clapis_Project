\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). It aims at explaining the application domain of the system to be developed and the system itself in terms of functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements and constraints. It also provides several modelizations of the system and typical use cases. It is intended for all the developers who will have to implement the system, the testers who will have to determine if the requirements have been met and the system analysts who will have to write specifications for other system that will relate to this one. It is also intended as a contractual basis thus being legally binding.

\subsection{Actual System}
The government of a large city wants to optimize its taxi service with a completely new application. Therefore we assume there are no previous systems to take into account.

\subsection{Scope}
The aim of the project is to provide a new app to better coordinate the taxi service. 
\\The app will have two main interfaces, one for the taxi driver and the one for the clients, and some publicly available APIs in order to expand and improve the service with additional features.
\\The taxi drivers will be able to login and signal to the service their availability. The system will then add the taxi to a queue for the zone it is currently in. The whole area managed by TAXInasecond is divided in quadrants of 2 km² and each one of those zones will have its own queue. When a call is made by a client the first taxi driver in the queue will be notified and will be able to pick the call up or reject it and pass it to the following available cab.
\\The client interface will provide two main functionalities, one to call a taxi for his current location and time for a specified number of passengers. Before confirmation of the call the system will allow the user to see an estimated time of arrival of the first taxi available.
\\The other functionality allows the user to place a reservation up to two hours before the due time and specify the starting point and the number of passengers for the ride.
\\Cancellations of calls can be made within the time it takes by the taxi driver to accept a call or, in case of a reservation, within 10 minutes before the due time.

\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make easier for a taxi to provide the service to his clients.
\item Guarantee a fair management of the taxies queue.
\item Reduce the time it gets for a taxi to get to the clients.
\item Make easier for the client to call for a taxi.
\item Make possible for the client to place a reservation for a taxi.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition and Acronyms}
\subsubsection{Acronyms}
\begin{itemize}
\item ETA:\@ estimated time of arrival: the time, estimated by the system, that the nearest taxi to the location of the call will take to get to the client's position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actors}
\begin{itemize}
\item Taxi drivers: after successfully logging in, taxi drivers are able to set their current state as available or not and to accept or refuse request.
\item Users: user are able to login or to ask the system for an ETA.
\item Registered users: registered users can

%\subsection{Description of the given problem}
%Since taxi services in big cities are generally hard to access to and even when they are not they are generally not organized on a big scale we plan to build a centralized coordinating app to solve the problem. 
%\\\\We propose a different approach to current taxies organizations which are mainly currently done with phone calls and just only one big queue that comprehends all taxies available for a city.
%This not only affect accessibility to the service but also increases pollution in urban areas. 
	%\\\\Our solution plans to make use modern technologies (mainly smartphones) to solve both problems: the app for the clients will make easier to call for a taxi or make a reservation for it, while the app for the taxies will organize the queueing in a more granular way in order to ensure coverage of city areas and reduce to a minimum the trip a car has to make to reach his client.

	\section{Introduction}

	\subsection{Purpose}
	This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Speciﬁcation Document (RASD). It aims at explaining the application domain of the system to be developed and the system itself in terms of functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements and constraints. It also provides several modelizations of the system and typical use cases. It is intended for all the developers who will have to implement the system, the testers who will have to determine if the requirements have been met and the system analysts who will have to write specifications for other system that will relate to this one. It is also intended as a contractual basis thus being legally binding.

	\subsection{Actual System}
	The government of the city wants to optimize its taxi service with a completely new application. Therefore, we assume there are no previous systems to take into account.

	\subsection{Scope}
	The aim of the project TAXINASECOND is to provide a new application to optimize the taxi service of the city. 
	\\The application will be available to the users in web and mobile forms and will have public APIs in order to expand and improve the service with additional features.
	\\The city managed by TAXINASECOND is divided in zones of 2 km² and each and every zone has its own queue of taxis. The queues are automatically computed by the system with the information it receives from the GPS of the taxis. When a taxi driver changes her state from not available to available the system automatically adds her to the queue of the zone she is currently in, based on the information of the GPS of the taxi. 
	\\Users that are not registered can only see the estimated time of arrival of the nearest taxi with TAXINASECOND.\@
	\\Registered users can also request a taxi or make a reservation for a taxi. Reservations can only be made at least two hours before the ride and must be done specifying the starting location, the destination and the meeting time. Requests, instead, only need the starting location and the destination.
	\\When a request is made the first taxi driver of the queue of the starting location’s zone is notified for accepting or rejecting the request. If a taxi driver rejects a request her state is put on unavailable until her changes it back to available. [PROMPT FOR CHANGE STATE?] If a taxi driver doesn’t accept or refuse a request within 1 minute, the request will be passed on to the next taxi driver in the queue and the first one will be moved to the end of the queue. If there are no available taxis in the zone of the request the system will propagate the request to the closest not empty queue.
	\\When a request is accepted the registered user that has made the request receives a notification from the system informing her of the code of the incoming taxi and the estimated waiting time.
	\\When a reservation is made, the system confirms it to the user and allocates a taxi 10 minutes before the meeting time. If a taxi for that zone is not available the request is then handled by finding the closest available taxi. 
	\\If in any kind of call a taxi does not reach the client’s location in an amount of time determined by the system using traffic and position information the call is by default canceled without penalties and both parts are notified.

	\subsection{Overview}
	This document is structured in three parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction: gives an high-level description of the software purposes and context.
		\item Overall Description: gives a general description of the application, focusing on the context of the system, going in details about domain assumptions and constraint. The aim of this section is to provide a context to the whole project and show its integration with the real world.
		\item Specific Requirements: this section contains all of the software requirements to a level of detail aimed to be enough to design a system to satisfy the said requirements, and testers to test that the system actually satisfies them. It also contains the detailed description of the possible interactions between the system and the world with a simulation and preview of the expected response of the system with given stimulation. (Details are given with Alloy specifications and UML diagrams)
	\end{itemize}


	\section{Overall description}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item for the users in both the
			\begin{itemize}
				\item registered user mode
				\item guest mode
			\end{itemize}
		\item for taxi drivers
